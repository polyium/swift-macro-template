## Discussion

> Swift has two kinds of macros:
> - *Freestanding macros* appear on their own, without being attached to a declaration.
>   - Syntax: `#[Mm]acro`
> - *Attached macros* modify the declaration that theyâ€™re attached to.
>   - Syntax: `@[Mm]acro`

### Debugging

Debugging macros can be difficult without first understanding a couple of key concepts.

```bash
swift package init --type macro
```
